# Deploying the Fixed Website Scraping Function

Since we're having issues with local Docker for Edge Function deployment, follow these steps to manually deploy the function through the Supabase Dashboard:

## Option 1: Deploy via Dashboard

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Edge Functions in the left sidebar
3. Find the `scrape-offer-context` function
4. Click "Edit" or "Deploy"
5. Delete the existing code and replace it with the updated code from:
   `/Users/josephkarim/Desktop/productled-academy/supabase/functions/scrape-offer-context/index.ts`
6. Deploy the function

## Option 2: Use Supabase CLI (if Docker is available)

If you have Docker Desktop running:

```bash
npx supabase functions deploy scrape-offer-context
```

## Key Changes in the Updated Function

We made these improvements to fix the website scraping issue:

1. Added proper browser-like headers to avoid CORS/blocking issues:
   - Set User-Agent to look like Chrome
   - Added Accept, Accept-Language, Referer headers
   - Added Cache-Control

2. Improved error handling:
   - Check response status and throw specific errors
   - Verify HTML content length before parsing
   - Added try/catch blocks around DOM parsing
   - Added validation for extracted content

3. Better error messages:
   - More specific error messages for different failure points
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Verifying the Deployment

After deploying, test the website scraping again from the application. The improved error handling and request headers should fix the issue with fetching external websites.
