Based on the comparison above:
1. Briefly acknowledge the website analysis if available.
2. Identify 1-2 key areas of potential discrepancy, missing information, or points needing clarification revealed by comparing the user's answers and the website analysis. Prioritize clarifications that will help define the Core Offer in the next steps.
3. Ask 2-3 specific, open-ended questions to prompt the user for more detail on these areas. Frame the questions constructively.

Example areas to look for:
- Mismatch between stated audience/problem and website tone/benefits.
- Value proposition difference.
- Missing key benefits mentioned by the user on the site.
- Unclear connection between features/benefits and the core problem.
