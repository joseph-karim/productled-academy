# Known Issues and Solutions

## Current Issues

### 1. Solution Type Limitations
**Issue**: Solutions currently only provide product-focused versions, lacking variety in solution types.

**Root Cause**: The `suggestSolutions` function in `ai.ts` is not properly utilizing the solution type system.

**Solution**:
- Updated the solution suggestion system to include three distinct types:
  - Product Features (technical implementations)
  - Resources/Tools (templates, integrations)
  - Content/Guides (documentation, tutorials)
- Each solution now includes a specific type classification
- AI suggestions are balanced across all three categories

### 2. Model Selection AI Suggestions
**Issue**: Model selection doesn't provide suggestions based on comprehensive input data.

**Root Cause**: The `suggestModel` function isn't effectively using all available context (description, endgame, challenges, solutions).

**Solution**:
- Enhanced model suggestion algorithm to consider:
  - Product description context
  - User endgame goals
  - Challenge patterns and magnitude
  - Solution types and implementation costs
- Added confidence scoring based on input completeness
- Improved reasoning output with specific references to input data

### 3. Feature AI Suggestions Limitations
**Issue**: Feature suggestions are only based on beginner solutions, limiting their effectiveness.

**Root Cause**: The `suggestFeatures` function is filtering for beginner-level challenges only.

**Solution**:
- Expanded feature suggestion scope to consider:
  - All user levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
  - Complete solution set
  - Selected model requirements
  - Progressive user journey
- Added category-based feature balancing
- Improved DEEP scoring accuracy

## Implementation Progress

### Completed
- Added solution type system
- Updated UI to support solution categorization
- Enhanced feedback system for solutions
- Improved model selection guidance

### In Progress
- Expanding feature suggestion algorithm
- Enhancing model selection confidence scoring
- Improving cross-reference between challenges and solutions

### Planned
- Add solution impact scoring
- Implement feature progression mapping
- Enhance model selection analytics

## Best Practices

### Solution Input
- Always specify solution type (product/resource/content)
- Include implementation cost estimate
- Consider scalability and maintenance
- Link solutions to specific challenges

### Model Selection
- Complete all previous sections first
- Provide detailed product description
- Define clear user outcomes
- Document key challenges and solutions

### Feature Definition
- Balance across feature categories
- Consider user progression path
- Align with selected model
- Focus on value demonstration
